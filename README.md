# Fundamentals of Programming.
## While Loops 
### Starter
* In the file starter.py create for loop that prints the numbers 3 to 33 (inclusive).

### Part 1 - While Loops - counting
* In the file part1.py, copy the code from the slide to see a simple while loop in action.
* Edit the code so that the range of numbers printed becomes 20 to 30

### Part 2 - While Loops - Go / Stop
* In the file part2.py, copy the code from the slide to see an indefinate loop.

### Part 3 - While Loops - Infinite Loops 
* In the file part3.py, copy the code from the slide to see an infinate loop.
* Edit the code so that the loop is no longer infinite.
